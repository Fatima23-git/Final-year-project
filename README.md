Mobile application-Car damage detection

Project Title: Car Damage Detection App
Type: Final Year Personal Project

Description:
This mobile application is designed to detect car damage severity (minor or severe) based on a photo uploaded by the user. The system uses machine learning to analyze the image and classify the level of damage, helping users quickly assess the situation.

My Role:
I developed the entire front-end and back-end of this project as a personal final year assignment. I was responsible for the user interface design, functionality, and integration of the image analysis feature.
